        <h3>About Me!</h3>
        
            <p> Jared Michael Eisenhauer was born on December 3rd, 1991 in an apartment on the north side of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He has been working creatively his whole life, with a focus on music composition and production, graphic design, digital animation and wordplay. His best work conveys a deep appreciation for all walks of life and color and a quick-witted sense of humor, ranging from bone-dry sarcasm to raunchy, boisterous slapstick. His crisp, shiny beats, love for animals of all shapes and sizes, and his unfathomably dank memes can stand as a beacon of light in an otherwise dark and troubled world. Jared lives in Detroit, Michigan with his father and his many pairs of socks.
